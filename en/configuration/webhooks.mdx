Webhooks enable real-time integration between the Evolution API and WhatsAppâ„¢, allowing automated data synchronization and sharing.

It is exactly this feature that enables the creation of self-service bots and multi-service systems.

## Activating webhooks

There is two ways to activate the webhook:
  - In the `.env` with global events
  - By calling the endpoint `/webhook/instance`

### Instance webhook events

Most of the users will prefer the activation by instance, this way is easier to control the events that are received, however in some cases a global webhook is needed this could be done by using the global webhook variable.

Here is an example with some commonly listened events:

```json /webhook/instance
{
  "url": "{{webhookUrl}}",
    "webhook_by_events": false,
    "webhook_base64": false,
    "events": [
        "QRCODE_UPDATED",
        "MESSAGES_UPSERT",
        "MESSAGES_UPDATE",
        "MESSAGES_DELETE",
        "SEND_MESSAGE",
        "CONNECTION_UPDATE",
        "TYPEBOT_START",
        "TYPEBOT_CHANGE_STATUS"
    ]    
}
```
### Parameters

| Parameter         | Type      | Required  | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| enabled           | boolean   | Required  | Enter "true" to create or change Webhook data, or "false" if you want to stop using it. |
| url               | string    | Required  | Webhook URL to receive event data. |
| webhook_by_events | boolean   | Optional  | Want to generate a specific Webhook URL for each of your events. |
| events            | array     | Optional  | List of events to be processed. If you don't want to use some of these events, just remove them from the list. |

<Note>
It is extremely necessary that the payload obey the rules for creating a JSON file, considering the correct arrangement of items, formatting, square brackets, braces and commas, etc.
Before consuming the endpoint, if you have questions about the JSON formatting, go to https://jsonlint.com/ and validate.
</Note>

### Global Webhook events 

Each instance's Webhook URL and events will be requested at the time it is created
Define a global webhook that will listen for enabled events from all instances

```bash .env
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_URL=''
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_ENABLED=false

# With this option activated, you work with a url per webhook event, respecting the global url and the name of each event
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS=false

## Set the events you want to hear, all listed events below are supported
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_APPLICATION_STARTUP=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_QRCODE_UPDATED=true

# Some extra events for errors
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS_WEBHOOK=
```

## Webhook by events

When enabling the WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS options in the global and local webhooks, the following paths will be added at the end of the webhook.

<Note>
Add on the end of the url the event name with a dash (-) between the words that compose the event for the event.
</Note>
 
### Example

 Assuming your webhook url was `https://sub.domain.com/webhook/`. Evolution will add automatically in the end of the url the name of the event when `webhook_by_events` is set to true.
