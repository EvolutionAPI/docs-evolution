## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation of Evolution API v2, ensure that you have already configured the necessary services, such as PostgreSQL and Redis. Follow the links below for more details:

- [Database Configuration](/v2/pt/requirements/database)
- [Redis Configuration](/v2/pt/requirements/redis)

## NVM Installation

Evolution API can be easily installed using Node Version Manager (NVM). Follow these steps to set up your environment and start the Evolution API on your server.

### Install NVM

First, download and install Node.js with the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Now, load the environment and install Node.js:

```bash
# Load NVM into the current environment
source ~/.bashrc

# Install and use the required Node.js version
nvm install v20.10.0 && nvm use v20.10.0
```

Confirm that NVM was successfully installed:

```bash
command -v nvm
```

<Info>  
If you haven't set it up yet, you can also configure your server's timezone with the command:

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```
</Info>

## Cloning the Repository and Installing Dependencies

Clone the official Evolution API v2 repository from the correct branch:

```bash
git clone -b v2.0.0 https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd evolution-api
npm install
```

## Environment Variables Configuration

Now let's configure the environment variables. First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific settings:

```bash
nano ./.env
```

Replace the default values with your configurations, such as database connection strings, API keys, server ports, etc.

<Info>  
Visit the [environment variables section](/v2/pt/env) for detailed instructions on how to configure your `.env` file.
</Info>

## Database Generation and Deployment

After setting up the environment, you will need to generate the Prisma client files and deploy the migrations to the database. Use the following commands, depending on the database you are using (PostgreSQL or MySQL):

1. Generate the Prisma client files:

    ```bash
    npm run db:generate
    ```

2. Deploy the migrations:

    ```bash
    npm run db:deploy
    ```
    
## Starting the Evolution API

After configuration, you can start the Evolution API with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## PM2 Installation and Configuration

Use PM2 to manage the API process:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start 'npm run start:prod' --name ApiEvolution
pm2 startup
pm2 save --force
```

<Info>  
If your server has more memory, consider configuring PM2 to utilize more resources:

```bash
pm2 start 'npm run start:prod' --name ApiEvolution -- start --node-args="--max-old-space-size=4096" --max-memory-restart 4G
```

This is recommended for servers with at least 4GB of RAM exclusively available for the Evolution API.
</Info>

To verify that the API is running, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the following response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Welcome to the Evolution API, it is working!",
  "version": "2.0.10",
  "clientName": "evolution01",
  "manager": "https://evo2.site.com/manager",
  "documentation": "https://doc.evolution-api.com"
}
```
