Evolution API can be easily installed using the Node Version Manager (NVM). Follow these steps to set up your environment and start the Evolution API on your server.

## Install NVM

First, download and install Node.js. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Now, just point to the NVM directories and install Node:

```bash Terminal
# Load bash source into the environment
source ~/.bashrc

# Directories
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

# Install node:
nvm install v20.10.0 && nvm use v20.10.0
```

Confirm that NVM was successfully installed:

```bash
command -v nvm
```

<Info>
    If you haven't configured it yet, you can also set up your private server's timezone with the following command:

    ```bash
    dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
    ```
</Info>

Clone the official GitHub repository to your private server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api.git
```

Next, navigate to the folder where the project is located.

```bash
cd evolution-api
npm install
```

Now, let's copy the `env.yml` file with the settings you need to edit.

```bash
cp src/dev-env.yml src/env.yml
nano src/env.yml
```

This command creates a copy of the default environment file.

Next, open the env.yml file in a text editor to enter your configuration settings. You can use nano, a command-line text editor, for this purpose:

```bash
nano src/env.yml
```

In the nano editor, navigate through the file and replace the default values with your specific settings. This can include database connection strings, API keys, server ports, etc.

<Info>
    Refer to the environment variables section for detailed instructions on how to set up your `env.yml` file.
</Info>

To start the Evolution API, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## Install and Configure PM2

Use PM2 to install PM2 and start the manager for the API process:

```bash Terminal
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start 'npm run start:prod' --name ApiEvolution
pm2 startup
pm2 save --force
```

<Info>
    Optional:
    You may need to allocate more memory for PM2, especially if your server has the capacity:

    ```sh
    pm2 start 'npm run start:prod' --name ApiEvolution -- start --node-args="--max-old-space-size=4096" --max-memory-restart 4G
    ```

    In the example above, it is assumed that your VPS has at least 4GB of RAM available exclusively for the Evolution API.

    Available memory may vary, we recommend at least 1GB to run Evolution.
</Info>

If you want to ensure the API is running, simply use your browser to access http://localhost:8080. This should be the response from your browser:

```json http://localhost:8080/
{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "Welcome to Evolution API, it is working!",
    "version": "1.x.x",
    "documentation": "http://localhost:8080/docs"
}
```

<Tip>
    Make your life easier with the JSON Formatter extension in [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/gpmodmeblccallcadopbcoeoejepgpnb?hl=pt-BR) or [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/json-formatter/hdebmbedhflilekbidmmdiaiilaegkjl).
</Tip>

EvolutionAPI has built-in Swagger endpoint documentation, which you can use to see all possible endpoints and test requests by accessing `http://localhost:8080/docs`.

## Nginx Configuration

First, let's install, start, enable, and test the Nginx service on your private server.

```bash Terminal
apt-get install -y nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl status nginx
```

If the information "Active: active (running)" appears in green, it means that Nginx is running and you can proceed to the next step.

### Remove Default Nginx Configuration

First, remove the default site file that comes enabled with Nginx:

```bash
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

### Create a new server block file in the directory

```bash
nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Next, paste the Nginx configuration into the `default.conf` file:

```nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name _;
  root /var/www/html/;
  index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
  }

location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
  }

# Long browser cache time can speed up repeat visits to your page
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|webp|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|css|js|ico|xml)$ {
       access_log off;
       log_not_found off;
       expires 360d;
  }

# disable access to hidden files
location ~ /\.ht {
      access_log off;
      log_not_found off;
      deny all;
  }
}
```

After making changes to the Nginx settings, it is essential to reload the Nginx service. This ensures that any modifications you have made are applied and become effective.

Run the following command in the terminal to reload Nginx:

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

Make the nginx user the owner of the web directory, by default, it is owned by the root user:

```bash
chown www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/html -R
```

Now, create a Virtual Host pointing to your subdomain by editing the `api` file:

```bash
cd ~
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api
```

Next, paste the Nginx configuration into the `api` file:

```nginx /etc/nginx/sites-available/api
server {
  server_name replace-this-with-your-cool-domain.com;

location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

Create a symbolic link between the `api` and `sites-enabled` files:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

Next, validate the Nginx configuration for the subdomain:

```bash
nginx -t
```

<Note>
    **This message should appear on your terminal if everything has been set up correctly:**
    _nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful_
</Note>

Reload Nginx for the changes to take effect.

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

## Install Certbot for SSL Certificate

To secure your Evolution API with an SSL certificate, you can use Certbot. Install Certbot using the following command:

```bash
snap install --classic certbot
```

### Certify the API subdomain

```bash
certbot --nginx -d replace-this-with-your-cool-domain.com
```

You will be asked if you want to enter an email to receive notifications when the generated certificate is close to its expiration date.

<Note>
    If the certification is successful, at the end of the process, a line with the following message will be displayed:

    "Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS"
</Note>
