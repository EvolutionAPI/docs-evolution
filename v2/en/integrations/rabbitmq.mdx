The Evolution API allows integration with **RabbitMQ** to manage events and message queues, facilitating efficient and scalable task communication and processing. Below, you will find information on how to configure RabbitMQ both globally and for individual instances.

## Global RabbitMQ Configuration

With the new global configuration, it's possible to centralize event processing in unified queues, rather than configuring separate queues for each instance. This simplifies event management as all system events are routed through specific queues based on the event type.

### Environment Variable Configuration

Here are the necessary environment variables to enable and configure RabbitMQ globally:

```plaintext
RABBITMQ_ENABLED=true
RABBITMQ_URI=amqp://admin:admin@localhost:5672/default
RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE_NAME=evolution_exchange
RABBITMQ_GLOBAL_ENABLED=true
```

### Configurable Events

With global mode enabled (`RABBITMQ_GLOBAL_ENABLED=true`), all events are queued in specific queues by event type rather than by instance. Here is a list of events you can activate globally:

```plaintext
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_APPLICATION_STARTUP=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_INSTANCE_CREATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_INSTANCE_DELETE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_QRCODE_UPDATED=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_MESSAGES_SET=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_MESSAGES_UPSERT=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_MESSAGES_EDITED=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_MESSAGES_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_MESSAGES_DELETE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_SEND_MESSAGE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CONTACTS_SET=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CONTACTS_UPSERT=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CONTACTS_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_PRESENCE_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CHATS_SET=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CHATS_UPSERT=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CHATS_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CHATS_DELETE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_GROUPS_UPSERT=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_GROUP_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_GROUP_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CONNECTION_UPDATE=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_CALL=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_TYPEBOT_START=true
RABBITMQ_EVENTS_TYPEBOT_CHANGE_STATUS=true
```

### Operation

- **Queue by Event**: In global mode, events are queued in specific queues for each event type. For example, all message update events (`MESSAGES_UPDATE`) will be queued in the same queue, regardless of the originating instance.
- **Ease of Management**: This approach simplifies the management and monitoring of events, allowing for centralized operations and simplifying the logic for message consumption in your system.

## RabbitMQ Configuration for Individual Instances

While global configuration is recommended for centralizing event processing, it's still possible to configure RabbitMQ for individual instances if segmentation by instance is needed.

### Endpoint for Individual Configuration

To configure RabbitMQ for a specific WhatsApp instance in the Evolution API, use the following endpoint:

~~~ http
POST [baseUrl]/rabbitmq/set/[instance_name]
~~~

### Request Body

Here is an example of a JSON request body to configure events for a specific instance:

~~~ json
{
    "enabled": true,
    "events": [
        "APPLICATION_STARTUP",
        "QRCODE_UPDATED",
        "MESSAGES_SET",
        "MESSAGES_UPSERT",
        "MESSAGES_UPDATE",
        "MESSAGES_DELETE",
        "SEND_MESSAGE",
        "CONTACTS_SET",
        "CONTACTS_UPSERT",
        "CONTACTS_UPDATE",
        "PRESENCE_UPDATE",
        "CHATS_SET",
        "CHATS_UPSERT",
        "CHATS_UPDATE",
        "CHATS_DELETE",
        "GROUPS_UPSERT",
        "GROUP_UPDATE",
        "GROUP_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE",
        "CONNECTION_UPDATE",
        "CALL",
        "NEW_JWT_TOKEN"
    ]
}
~~~

<Note>  
Remove unused events to optimize RabbitMQ resource usage.
</Note>

When configuring RabbitMQ integration for individual instances, adjust the event array in the JSON body to include only the events relevant to that instance.

## Final Considerations

RabbitMQ configuration in the Evolution API offers flexibility to manage events centrally with global configuration or segmented by instance, depending on your system's needs. Use the global configuration to simplify event management in complex environments, or configure it individually for more granular control.
