Webhooks allow real-time integration between the Evolution API and WhatsAppâ„¢, enabling automated data synchronization and sharing.

This feature is exactly what makes it possible to create self-service bots and multi-service systems.

## Enabling Webhooks

There are two ways to enable the webhook:
  - In the `.env` file with global events
  - By calling the `/webhook/instance` endpoint

### Instance Webhook Events

Most users will prefer instance-based activation, as it makes it easier to control the received events. However, in some cases, a global webhook is necessary. This can be done using the global webhook variable.

Here is an example with some common events being listened to:

```json /webhook/instance
{
  "url": "{{webhookUrl}}",
  "webhook_by_events": false,
  "webhook_base64": false,
  "events": [
      "QRCODE_UPDATED",
      "MESSAGES_UPSERT",
      "MESSAGES_UPDATE",
      "MESSAGES_DELETE",
      "SEND_MESSAGE",
      "CONNECTION_UPDATE",
      "TYPEBOT_START",
      "TYPEBOT_CHANGE_STATUS"
  ]    
}
```
### Parameters

| Parameter         | Type    | Required  | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled           | boolean | Yes       | Enter "true" to create or change Webhook data, or "false" if you want to stop using it.                           |
| url               | string  | Yes       | Webhook URL to receive event data.                                                                                |
| webhook_by_events | boolean | No        | Whether to generate a specific Webhook URL for each of your events.                                               |
| events            | array   | No        | List of events to be processed. If you don't want to use some of these events, simply remove them from the list.  |

<Note>
It is extremely necessary that the payload follows the rules to create a JSON file, considering the correct arrangement of items, formatting, brackets, braces, commas, etc.
Before consuming the endpoint, if you have doubts about the JSON formatting, go to https://jsonlint.com/ and validate.
</Note>

### Global Webhook Events

Each instance's Webhook URL and events will be requested when they are created.
Set up a global webhook that will listen to enabled events from all instances.

```bash .env
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_URL=''
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_ENABLED=false

# With this option enabled, you work with one URL per webhook event, respecting the global URL and each event's name
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS=false

## Set the events you want to listen to; all events listed below are supported
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_APPLICATION_STARTUP=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_QRCODE_UPDATED=true

# Some extra events for errors
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS_WEBHOOK=
```
## Supported Events

## Webhook by Events

When enabling the WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS options in both global and local webhooks, the following paths will be appended to the end of the webhook URL.

<Note>
Add the event name at the end of the URL with a hyphen (-) between the words that make up the event.
</Note>
 
### Example

Suppose your webhook URL is `https://sub.domain.com/webhook/`. Evolution will automatically add the event name to the end of the URL when `webhook_by_events` is set to true.

## Locating Webhook

If necessary, there is an option to locate any active webhook on the specific instance.

| Method | Endpoint                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | [baseUrl]/webhook/find/[instance]     |


### Data returned from the request:

Calling the endpoint will return all information about the webhook being used by the instance.

```json Result
{
  "enabled": true,
  "url": "[url]",
  "webhookByEvents": false,
  "events": [
    [events]
  ]
}
```
